Genetic Engineering is the study and discipline of modifying and manipulating the composition of an organism through DNA, resulting in a gene transformation. This leads to a change in the phenotype of an individual or organism. There are multiple ways through which this technology is used, including gene splicing, editing, and recombinant DNA technology.

The year 1953 was an important milestone in the exploration of genetic enigmas as James Watson and Francis Crick, using X-ray crystallography, made the groundbreaking discovery of DNAâ€™s double helix structure. Thus, Watson and Crick were pioneers in this discovery. In the 1960s, there was yet another breakthrough, and this time a foundational one modelled by Hamilton Smith. Hamilton Smith's discovery of restriction enzymes was a crucial advance. Scientists could alter and recombine genetic material by using these enzymes to cut DNA at precise places. This finding established the foundation for further genetic engineering methods. In genetic research, restriction enzymes are a valuable tool since they can introduce foreign DNA for gene-editing purposes by cutting DNA at a specified place.

Mass production of insulin, human growth hormones, follistim (an infertility treatment), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, vaccinations, and numerous more medications have all been achieved in medicine through genetic engineering. It is used in agriculture to increase crop properties like improved nutritional value, herbicide tolerance, and pest resistance. Crops can even be engineered to build up an immunity against chemical pesticides and environmental pollutants.

The invention of Artificial and Synthetic Chromosomes, by Dr. Craig Venter, is also an advancement in Genetic Engineering. In addition to making it easier to engineer several genes into plants, advances in molecular biology and an increased understanding of biological processes will facilitate the integration of whole and unique biochemical pathways or processes. Looking forward, the field presents intriguing possibilities and diverse applications, seeing for a better future for mankind.
