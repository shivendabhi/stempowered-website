‘Dear, just opt for science, get into one of the top colleges, and your life’s set’. 

This is a phrase many Indian teens get to hear, and, sometimes, it’s not even a choice. Generally, parents believe that there’s no scope in other fields, leading kids to opt for subjects they might not even like. When someone scores well in their 10th finals and still chooses humanities or commerce, it’s a shock to people.

For some context, the Indian curriculum for 11th-12th grade is divided into 4 main streams, with 5 subjects each. English is compulsory and one is chosen as per your liking.

The four streams are:
1. Non-Medical: Physics, Chemistry, Maths
2. Medical: Physics, Chemistry, Biology
3. Commerce: Accounts, Business Studies, Economics
4. Humanities: Political Science, Geography, Psychology, History, Economics (any 3)

Colleges aren’t the final destination, they’re merely launchpads or stepping stones that help propel you in the right direction. But for those few years before college, students put all their efforts into getting into the crème de la crème.

A huge population of around 800,000 aspirants trying for engineering, and around 1,700,000 for medical colleges annually, coupled with only a few thousand elite seats, is a dangerous concoction.

Many start their preparation for the dreaded JEE (Joint Engineering Entrance) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical colleges) exams as young as middle school, ready to sacrifice their social life. It’s not unheard of for parents to send their children away from home to ‘Kota’, the so-called city of dreams, the hub of all coaching institutes of India, to ensure that they have the best chance at getting into IITs or AIIMS, our Ivy-league equivalents.

Imagine a stressed student, studying for more than 6 hours a day, away from home, not suited to the new environment or food. This is the reality for most kids living alone or in hostels in Kota. Kota is known as the heart of coaching, but due to such intense competition and isolation, it is also a place synonymous with student suicides. 

Becoming a doctor or an engineer was the scope of STEM for the previous generation, but now people are learning about niche jobs, and new fields like AI are opening up.

Maybe you like computer science but can’t stand chemistry; maybe it’s the other way around. Regardless of what you’re interested in, the landscape is changing now. Our educational system is transforming, trying to inculcate a more hands-on approach. Big colleges like the IITs have started offering remote diplomas and degrees to make quality STEM education a bit more accessible to all. The situation’s not as bleak as it was years ago but change will take time.
